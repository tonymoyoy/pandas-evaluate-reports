# pandas-evaluate-reports
Generate report based on two excel documents

This script was created to generate a workload summary from two diferent reports of ticket tools.

From one report I can get hours per person and from the other just the diferent tasks which I need to be evaluate to estimate the hours and generate the summary.

The learnings from this script is how to create new columns and dataframes.
